What can I do?
I can’t take up and down like this no more, babe
I need to find out where I am
Before I reach the stars
Yeah, before I step on Mars
I’ve been spinning and I’m blue
Thinking 'bout my life and how to change it
Crazy thoughts I’d like to leave behind
Oh yeah, it’s gonna blow my mind
Deadly days and killer nights
It’s hard to keep things tight
I don’t have a love affair
With all these lonely flights
Promises of liquid gold
Mend my heart but not my soul, yeah

You know it won’t be long
So shake it on
You know it won’t be long

If we’re gonna do this thing
Let’s do it and do it right
I know we can reach the stars

People scream but I can’t hear
I don’t care too much
Crocodile and toxic tears can't kick this sense of touch
Life has lost its eloquence
But I can’t sit it on the fence
Feel like being treacherous
With the music still infecting us

Take my hand (automaton)
Cold like a junkie (automaton)
I'm an ice cold man (automaton)
(I'm an ice cold man)

Why am I crying for you?

All this love I felt for you
Has gone away to another place (It's a digital life)
I put my faith in a digital world
Where they've given me
Eyes without a face
I steal the moon on silver nights
Remind myself I am someone
My soul is null and void tonight
I'm automaton (I'm automaton)

I'm so tough
Can't you see me running?
See, I can touch
Can you feel me coming?
I see the world
And cry for freedom
These metal eyes, they can't disguise
The fact that I
Need something to believe in
But then I'm dying for you

And took off into inner space (It's a digital life)

Inside I know, I'm null and void

You lost my love but someone found it
Now when the rain falls upon my head
I don't think of you that much at all
Just one thing seemed to make you care
Who's gonna drive and take you home?

Only a fool could walk away from me this time
I look up to Heaven, every star I see is mine
Only a fool could walk away from me this time
I'm walking on air, and every cloud is cloud 9

You get your kicks playing stupid tricks
But I've found another crush, You got me now
Game, set and match, don't seem to be no catch

Yeah, it's Hang Ten Heems
The most waviest creature
She touch it in Miami and every other city

I'm with my family at Wild Water Kingdom
Wild Water Kingdom, Wild Water Kingdom
Bitch, I'm wavy, Wild Water Kingdom
I'm a fucking wave pool, Wild Water Kingdom

Wild Water Kingdom, meet me at the wave pool
Me, I'm on that new wave, 80's baby, stay cool
Himanshu was born in America
Jamiroquai, miracle
Mile high, eyes wide shut, spiritual
Lyrical, miserable, gibberish, I'm out with the metaphysical
Digital, Cancer sign, Pisces rising
Water is my friend, it keep me from dying
Those are both water signs
Heems will fucking Sergeant Slaughter rhymes
I'm Papa Shango, the godfather D-Lo
""Who's That? Brooown!"", why bother? Weezer
Werner Herzog, Herman, Hertz
U-Haul rider, peace to Breyer(?)
Have my rider ready, ready
I'm a peace believer, but I need my guava
You might also like

Freedom for the heathens who scheming for cheese
Believe in them, please, they need us to reach
A peace with the place that's filled with the trees
Peace to the L with trees that's laced with E
Peace to love, peace is in the sea
A candle in the wind, my swag on Princess Di
People want my picture, and wish that I would die
I'm Dodi Fayed, and my codeine's never lying
I'll OD then I'm dying, an OG with the wilding
I'm the Jamaican crab in the mermaid movie
Her maid's groovy, but Herman's moody
I'm Kelly Slater, the waviest fella
Crazy with cheddar, spacey like Heathers
I'm in Australia, catching a wave
Catching a plane to catch me some shade
Cash me some checks, stack them, I'm paid


Free Max B, you're not a wavy creature
Your girl bump me through her Macbook speakers
Your mom love me like I'm her preacher
Your dad love me like I'm the pitcher
Of his favorite baseball team
I ball till I'm y'all, I get that cream
I'm Hang Ten Heems, and everybody love me
Move like Bugsy in a rugby
People think I'm Spanish like Dru Ha
Heems, Himanshu, new school, woo hah!
I got you all in check
I got my family all some checks
Now they wanna see me eat their dust and ether
Cause I'm on that new wave like Flock of Seagulls
On that new wave like XTC
So they wanna empty me of MP3's

I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary

The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki, I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire, rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubik's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight; I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11, meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the ""I"" in ""try""?
Ryan vibes like cyanide; I am proud
To say that I've evolved, there's only one ""I"" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself, vibing to my Lost Sessions
I'm legendary
You might also like
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary

I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
'Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow, the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary5Embed"

Rock dust light star
And it's coming at you, baby, yeah

I'm a man on the moon
I hope I don't come back too soon
Am I the only one to see the light?
No use in getting down upon your knees tonight
So I don't feel love
Cause I got no faith
I've seen those twisted lies thrown back into my face
I've seen the crazy doctrines of the human race
I must be alone
How could it be
Your gift to me (to me)
A salvo of heavy artillery
It's nothing but your war
You can call it what you like
I know where I'm from
And I'm cold and dark
And all the sinners are just saints without sparks
I'm having trouble telling them apart, oh yeah

Coming at you
Rock, dust, light, star
And it's coming at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour

Those stars for you and me
Waiting like silent killers in the night
Atomic legions that you can never fight
I've never felt I've ever prayed
Don't have to join in with in the other slaves
I'm not the only one who feels betrayed, yeah
See the more I think about it
I'm born against the grain
Ooh, ooh, I won't be born again
Salvation's coming from on high
(Coming at you baby, through the sky, from on high, yeah)

Maybe there's no place left for my wounded soul
Maybe the king of kings finally lost control of it

Stop what you're doing, get into this groove
Can't you see the signs?
Carried away in a wave of devotion
With the music pumping
The stars are shining so bright
Stop what you're doing, get into this groove
Can't you see the signs?

Slip on out and slip on into his shoes
He dances like a plasticine machine
Some guys seize the day
Some guys got the way
Sweet old-school attraction
He wants your lovin' tonight

He tells you you're no cheapskate reproduction
You're sure that he must be the real thing
Well you're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
'Cos your friends don't like his haircut
But he wants your lovin' tonight

Oh, seven brides might meet the seven brothers
That doesn't mean that you are one of them
Seventeen other lovers left the scene
But you don't think that you're the go-between

Oh, those days turn into years and you did nothing
And now you wish you'd been left there on the shelf
Baby, you're an angel
Doing things for him and not yourself

Those flaming eyes that flicker in the fast lane
Don't tell of broken hearts he's left behind
It's hard not to succumb
But you were stuck under his thumb
You won't have a word of it
Your mama's going out of her mind

This is not the thing she wanted for ya
Chained up to the kitchen sink of life
Thirteen years of negligence
But you're too far in to jump the fence
I bet you rue the day
When you took his lovin' that night

So hard for you to see through smoke and mirrors
How come you never look before you leap
Well, baby, you're an angel
You didn't know he's playing this for keeps
Did you see the good, the bad, the ugly?
They told you it was far too far to drop
Oh, baby, you're an angel
Crying on a shoulder made of rock

And there's a night train
I know he's gonna stick it out
Ride that crazy white horse
He's a man
He's a pig in paradise
But it might get blown into the winds tonight
Seems life's a record stuck
And that it couldn't make it off
He's a cool hand Luke
He's Jimmy cross slippery slope
He's just possessed and crazy
Thank you for nothing baby
All those dreams are going up in smoke
I say, hey Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you gotta learn how to break the chain
Oh, yeah
There's a night train to your heartbreak, get on
It's the big time, that's been driving you on
Note my blue sky, hanging over, your head
So what cha gonna do Floyd? I've got to know
Got to know what you're going to do, yeah
What cha gonna do? What cha gonna do?
What cha gonna do Floyd? Do Floyd
I got to know, I've got to know what you're going to do
There's a night train to your hearth break, get on
It's the big time that has been driving you on and on
Note my blue sky, hanging over your head
Know my blue skies hanging over you, you
Come on, Floyd
Shoot em up and shoot em down
Cut down that spot of freedom
Kick it, stick it, do it what you can
Got me the pissys fit
Get rid of all that shit
Floyd, can't forget, you're a man
I said, hey Floyd you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you got the time on your hands to mend
Come on, Floyd
Gotta learn to break that chain now, baby
Hey Floyd, gotta learn to break that chain now, baby
Get off that shotgun ride
I know how much you tried
To blow the high priest's ass off paid away
You're no extravaganza
Do the play in the dirty dancer
Hell man, they even know your name

Has gone straight to his head
Drip, drip, drip and he's on the rocks
With the sidewalk for a back
Had big ideas on big eyed checks

Goodbye, goodbye
Seems like I knew you since you were a little girl
Cried out to you, never thought that you'd ruin my world
Now we're all broke up, I glimpse you on the street
Just gotta put up, shut up because you spread the sheets
This world keeps spinning around but I just don't care
I had my name written up in lights, wanted you to share
I don't mind to do my thing, do yours yourself
I can't stick around here, no, it's bad for my health

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
Though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(And there's no one to hold me)

Got your letter just yesterday
So you might as well get out of here because you've been paid
It doesn't matter cause I've got my lover and she's into me
But I'm finding it hard inside to set you free

Why can't we be together?
Could you love me? Don't hate me
I don't see, why can't we live together?
Maybe we can get it on, people, we can get along
Should be our destiny
There's a cold streak living inside us
There's no rainbows, just bullets and bombs
And if you want to rise up, we got to stick our love inside us
We can make this hate stop (It's all the same, all the shame)
Now don't you want to rise up?

We been giving hate a chance
(We got all this love to give, you know)
And the love will be running out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away

So why do we see these colors?
It's only skin deep, don't mean a thing
So clear, underneath this, we're all brothers
Can't you see it's killing us, can't you see it's killing us?
Can't you see it's killing me? Trigger happy fantasy
So stand up and be so strong now
Freedom is not so far away
If you know you want to rise up
(We've wanted to rise up for so long now)
We can make this hate stop
Now don't you want to rise up?

And suffocates our only dream

And wants no part of it at all
And as the weeping leaves of autumn curl
He feels the savage winter call
See far below the dust of conflict settles on the hill
Where there was no escape before
And as he spreads his wings and soars up to another level
He brings the icy prophecies of war
Black crow, black crow, tell me where you really go
When you fly into the sunset, high in evening sky
Black crow, black crow, tell me what you really know
Will we flourish in this hurricane, or will we fall and die?
While children lose their souls and so much more
To ragged armies of the field
A vicious fanfare cries appeasing hungry savages
To trigger that their fate is surely sealed
I wonder where that black crow sleeps as day beckons the night
Or if he even sleeps at all
I wonder what he thinks of all the human traffic far below
That's struggled on the road so, so long
Tell me black crow, black crow silently you pass above
Understanding everything but you know nothing at all
Black crow black crow, tell me what you really know
Do you understand the pain that we feel down here at all
Black crow, black crow, tell me where you really go
When you fly into the sunset, high in evening sky
Black crow, black crow, tell me what you really know
Will we flourish in this hurricane, or will we fall and die?
Will we flourish in this hurricane, or will we fall and die?

Dry my eyes once again

Been so long, I've been hopelessly confused

This can never really end
It's infinitely sad
Can someone tell me when
Something good became so bad
So if you have a cure
To me would you please send
A picture of my life
With a letter telling how
It should really be instead

The precipice is there
But will I ever dare?
Throw myself in the sky
So, at last, I can die
See, I've become a man who
Holds nothing too dear
Who will mind?
If I just disappear?

Well, it change you inside out
And then it flows
To the places unfamiliar, yeah
Let me tell, I'm hot for you
You're so hot for me, so get on, girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm hot for you, you're hot for me
So get on, I wanna get it on with you
I'm sendin' you a message
I hope you got the sense to read between the lines
You know that on the back it says that
For me you never seem to find the time
Come on, I've waited for your phone calls
But you must be uptown havin' fun
And when you do that thing you do, I get so exited too
But you never think to ask me if I wanna come with you
So honey, where do we go from here?
You know, baby
I've been tryin' to find out
But I'm still some way from knowin'
You know I am, come on
It's not exactly clear, no, no
The love you should be givin' me
Is the love you're rarely showin'
That's the way love goes, that's the way
That's the way it goes for me and you
Come on, let me tell you now

Soon I'm gonna lose my patience, girl
I can't understand what you're about
'Cause there's no communication
Oh, you say you love to love me, love to love me
But you always keep your distance
So honey, strike me off your list
If your love comes with a twist
'Cause I want the part that lingered
On my lips when we first kissed
Say do you love me, if you do
Tell me somethin' and make it true
Do you love me I need to know
Now, baby can't you tell me where we're gonna go?
Where do we go from here
I've been trying to find out
But I'm still some way from knowin'
Hey, it's not exactly clear, no, no
The love you should be givin' me
But the love you're never showin'
Now that's the, that's the way love goes, yeah
And where it's takin' us
Well, we don't know, we don't know
So lets move straight on ahead
And tow in the line between us, girl
I think I'd sooner make this love dead
Than waste all my time on you, yeah
I'm wastin' all my time
I'm gonna learn, learn, learn
That's the way love goes, that's the way
It's gonna hurt me so bad but I won't let it show
I get the feelin' that it's gonna
Tear out my mind till I can no longer breath
I know I'm gonna learn, learn, learn
That's the way love goes

Where do we go from here?
I've been tryin' to find out
But I'm still some way from knowin', yeah
Hey, it's not exactly clear
The love you should be giving me
But the love you're rarely showin'
Hey, but that's the way love goes, yeah
You know that that's the way love goes
I'm so hot for you, I'm so hot for you

There's no way
I'm coming back to you
I just stopped to say
That everything we did is through
You tried to undermine
The better ranges of my nature
But soon you're going to find
You should have started talking straighter

Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, babe
To see you go to ground

Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I hope you're happy that way

There's no hope
For peace and reconciliation
You're quick to play your hand
But what you haven't learnt is patience
So look before you leap
To tell the world your coloured story
It's clear your talk is cheap
Do anything to get your glories

So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Shout about

Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

And there's no love
Ever to be lost between us
I guess this is because
The damage you've done is so grievous
So I hang my head
To dwell on what might have been
But what you left instead
Pieces of a broken dream

Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, babe
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Something to shout about

Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

Don't you see that

It is a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless, twisting, of our new technology
Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, It's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told

Now, it occurred to me
As I awoke from deeper dreams
All this evolution
And still I don't know what it means
And it gets so hard for me to change
When there's an easy way to earn
Why should I work my fingers to the bone? (to the bone?!?)
Is this what I truly deserve?
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story
Just another story baby

Nobody make a move, this kid's got you covered
He was just seventeen, trying to get on like his dead brother
Mama couldn't do a thing about him
Though she hurt inside and daddy wants his son back
While him knows he's still alive
Stick up kid, thinking you're a glory boy
Oh, fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Like a speed freak king of amphetamine
Still running those rocks on the front line
Get up tight when its your turn
A bullet in the head is the lesson learned
One of these days you're gonna say goodbye
Telling everyone you've never been so high
Born the same time that you die
You're pushing that draw like you're superfly
Heaven help all with no way out
That's what this is all about
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story, baby
Hit him with it now
Come on now hit him with it now
Stick up kid
Come on
Ahaha-ha-ha, I got you where I want ya!
Nobody make a fucking move!
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
I got ya! I got ya where I want ya now, nobody make a fucking move
Nobody make a move, oh, this kid's got you covered
He was just seventeen, trying to get on like his dead brother
Oh, mama couldn't do a thing about him, though she hurt inside
And Daddy wants his son back, while him knows he's still alive
Stick up kid, thinking you're a glory boy
Oh, fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Still running those rocks on the front line
Like a speed freak king on amphetamine
Get up tight when its your turn

There’s a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine
Oh, does your heart yearn
For a place we can go where the
Troubles of our time are far away
Hey, they are so far away
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkest days are trouble free
There are so many wondrous things for you to see

If you find that something’s going wrong
Look around at what you’re running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time

I found love in that way
And I’m never sad, and I’m always glad
Anything you give me today
I now will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
‘Cause they don’t know where they’re coming from
And there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time

There’s a stillness in time
Search the spaces of my mind

If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
I guess I’ll have to search the spaces of my mind
For that stillness in time

I found love in that way
And I’m never sad, and I’m always glad
Anything you give me today
I now will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
‘Cause they don’t know where they’re coming from
And there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time

Ooh
I know that this
Is the peripheral side of bliss
There is no name
For the love I have won’t stay the same
I have done wrong
If I don’t know where I’m coming from
If I don’t see, the things that are inside of me
A part of me, in front of me
Oh, say it’s all around me
Said I know
Said I want to find that
Stillness in time, stillness in time, hey!

It was 400 years or more
Since you came to crucify
And they were taken far away from home
There were promises of paradise
But if they had been told that they
That they would be sold this way
To satisfy the souls of chosen men
See, I had to look carefully
At the shame of my ancestry
To redefine the storyline again

Hey, if I was taken for a day
And shown another way
Now every child can learn a different thing
See, I tried a million times
But I had to change my mind, oh

And this is what he said
As he took away the blue above the clouds, oh

With these chains of hypocrisy

Forever stained by blood in which you tread (hey, yeah)

Woo, woah, woah, yeah

Have you gone astray or lost your way?
You should have seen me yesterday
Well I knew this kind of love was written in the stars
It's only once or twice that you're in line with Mister Moon
Then it was you, you took me on your cloud
And gave me flowers for my pain, but with some degree of certainty
My destiny seemed to slip away from me
Yeah, before I got to know your name, aw, honey

Just give me a chance, I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance, so how come I can't dance with you?
You really turn me on
You're the one that makes me smile

It's Mister Moon who plays in tune, Mister Moon who knows
And if it's Mister Moon who gives the sign, then that's the sign that goes
I never know what to do 'til I'm there with you
Yeah, I'm right on

Did you lose your mind for a day?
You don't remember anyway
Like the waters of a dream encapsulate my mind
A place I haven't seen sits at the end of space and time
So lost in love that I think I'm blind
To perchance upon this circumstance is something of a miracle
So spiritual, it's vergin' on the physical (How?)

But often more than not this is abused
And the faces of a tired generation
Have decided they are sick of being used

Still the same, it'll never change until the end
Is to buy the appreciation of the nation
To cover the mistakes you must defend
And you say there'll be a chance for everyone
To protest against your calculated greed
But I can see and into the future
Won't be long before the welfare
Send me letters telling me how much they need
And it's not been in my interest to please them
For the only interest rate to fall is mine

Armageddon's come too near, too too near, now
Foresight is the only key
To save our children's destiny
The consequences are so grave, so so grave, now
The hypocrites, we are their slaves
So, my friends, to stop the end
On each other, we depend
Oh, we depend

Mountain high and river deep
Stop it going on
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep
Oh, people, stop it going on

Money's on the menu in my favourite restaurant
Well, don't talk about quantity
Cause there's no fish left in the sea
Greedy men been killing all the life there ever was
And you'd better play in nature's way
She will take it all away
And don't try and tell me you know more than her

Presuming that
Nobody wants a war
There's so many people praying
Just to find out if they're staying
But lately stately governments
And disillusioned leaders
So full of empty promises
But rarely do they feed us
Put our backs against the wall
Or don't we count at all?
Can't you decide?
Are you mesmerised?
Do you know which side you're standing?
Cause when it falls
Gon' take us all
Gotta know what we're demanding

Say that we have all the time we need to make it right

Express those rules when I was born

Not higher education
If it ain't no natural law, then you can keep your regulations
Cause if I like it, I do it

Keep on moving, though they wanna
Bring me down
I gotta run for the cover

Because I like another drink?

Well don't talk about quantity, cos there's no fish left in the sea

And you better play it nature's way or she will take it all away
And don't try tell me you know more than her about right or wrong
Now you've upset the balance man, done the only thing you can
Now my life is in your hands

Ayo King Of The Dot, put your money where your mouth is. Back to Baysics, Los Angeles. Make some noise y'all. We're getting into the secret battle for the event so I'll jump right into it. Battler to my right introduce yourself

Hey guys I'm Carter Deems. I just want to like, if you don't mind, I wanna say something like, serious, like I took this battle like, I've been doing jokes and stuff but I took this battle absolutely serious. And before we get started I wanted to say two things. Uh, first is um, I took this as serious as I could, you know and I promise that I'm not gonna forget any lines, I'm not gonna stumble. I'm not gonna choke. The second thing I wanted to say is um, um...the second thing I wanted to say is um.................
The second thing I wanted to say is good luck Immaculate

All the way from Portland, battler to my left introduce yourself

Yo, it's Illmaculate, make some noise y'all. Now I don't usually do this but I just want to make a couple shout outs like on some real shit. Um, shout out Jonathan, Thaddeus Von Hammerschmidt III, Jamiroquai, 2Pac, B.E.N.E.F.I.T., Wilma, Mrs. Boots and uh, I know I'm slipping on some of their names but all of Carter Deems' cats. Make some noise

Sometimes it looks like you have a beard
And sometimes it doesn't
Sometimes I have fun at family reunions
Sometimes I fight my cousin
This dude will get sonned/sunned like the light above him
When I spit truth in my verses but I'm not Bible thumping
Get big like Michael Duncan
When I send his body flying through the air like Michael dunking
Looking like Mike Tyson punched him
When it comes to Starbucks I hate the coffee but I like the muffins
Real rap
Real rap, Illmac...what the heck am I doing here?
I'm about to get bodied so hard you should give me a firm chest bump as a souvenir
A penny for my thoughts? Well I put my two cents here
Your sideburns are too sincere
I'm about to poop in here
{Battle gets side tracked due to the sounds of fighting on the roof that broke out between Dizaster and Billy Boondocks}
Carter on point for the bucks, it's like I'm about to shoot a deer
There's a lizard that lives in my couch, that's why I move in fear
My favorite color is blue this year and everything I do is weird
You wanna face me here well it's gonna get nasty like Rick Rubin's beard
I try to fit in at parties and say stuff like, ""Hey guys you wanna do some beer?""
I let a cat live in my desk at work and now I need a new career
I'm 'bout to catch a body, it's like I'm about to do a cheer
In my shower you can catch me with a loofah near
I'm 'bout to stretch him out, get loose in here
Cause when the hands go, it's Van Gogh, you lose an ear (losin' here)
I'm taking over, hopping in the driver's seat, you'll see defeat/the feet
I use my shoes to steer
I don't care if you keep the Ruger near or if you have your shooters here
You could've come armed with an army and I'll still take your tanks down like scuba gear
I should've brought my tuba here
Hit him in the mouth with that brass, now he need new veneers
I feel really stupid here
Still I bring bar after bar after bar for Ill', you gonna see hot rounds
I'm 'bout to cook soup up here
When Carter hop on stage his dead jokes come to life
You think I'm gassed up? Well watch the crowed get ripe when I start to cook like an oven light
Gilmore Girl's poster, that's what I hug at night
You didn't think my name would spread but now I'm on a roll like a butter knife
2% milk? That's all I drink, that's something light
Florescent bulbs? Those are some thin lights
We about to have fun tonight but this dude bit off more than he chew; that's an under bite
I'm not going to run tonight, to be honest I expected a tougher fight
Cause when he spit, it's just like he's starving for attention; that's a hunger strike
This is a weirder match up than the other guys
I'll walk into a Long John Silver's and make the money fly
I can use all the support I get, shout out to my upper thighs
I'm pretty sure I forgot a couple rhymes but I'll just wing it like a butterfly
If you pop up you gon' see that toast, I'll let that butter fly
Time
You might also like
Alright ch'all
You know his name, from Copenhagen to the Golden State
It's Deems
No other battle rapper could know his pain
Let alone hold the weight on his shoulder blades
So here's how it's gonna go today
From here on every line I use on him is a used condom
That's DNA throwaways, let's go!
I guarantee he'll be like
{Illmaculate does a Carter Deems impression}
""Ayo""

That doesn't sound like me
 {Still using his Carter Deems impersonation}
""It kinda does
You can't see Deems when I travel
And it's ironic that I love cats cause you the one that's gonna flee/flea from this battle""
Alright, change of scenes
His name is Deems, rugged as the Marlboro Man
But yet sensitive as Maybelline facial cream
He's every ladies dream
You think Drake can sing?
Psst, his voice is like angel wings and halo rings
I'm sorry if I'm on a tangent I get distracted doing addition
That's A.D.D
When I think Carter I think downpours and the crown yours
Your raining/reigning king
I mean, that's how this match-up came to be
Lux wanted a 100K, KOTD wouldn't pay the fee
So naturally the next thing that came to me was Carter
Plus he only charged 'em....80 G's
A Pay Per View percentage, an ATV
Three music videos, OVO made 'em free
A beat tape by 
And a cat playground as a place to breed that's safe from fleas
Okay, that's real shit, that's facts
True story, that's true story
I heard Carter sells rocks
He got homies surrounded by cell blocks
FEDS got his phone tapped, so he gotta get his cell blocked
Shit, I heard he really run the town
He literally cells blocks
Psst, that's stupid
Plus, T-Pain watch his battles with pom poms, lighting L's
I heard he got chron' for clientele
He buys and sells
You be eyeballing grams like, ""Your mom's mom is fine as hell!""
Well, when this shit drop
I know, they'll probably think this is Sak's Fifth to a thrift shop
I mean as soon as I spit he'll rebuttal my shit, watch
He'll even rebuttal my rebuttals...sick, stop
Aye Anygma, he freestyles so amazingly
I must be the Malaysian Lee, how I'll get my flips topped
Cart's skill at doing cartwheels, I'd even get my flips topped
There should be another bar here but I can't think of another way flip top
So c'mon, how do you battle a mixture of God's trinity
The Star Wars lost trilogy, John Kennedy, Dom's infantry
I almost bought a cat to give you props literally
And I hope you win cause life is all about the small victories
Time
I own a microwave that's the same color as a microwave
That's the same color as light blue
But I don't use it anymore cause it electrocuted me and the light's blew
I went to your Facebook page and liked it just so I could go back and unlike you
You wanna fight dude?
Well I'll split his wig like Dwight Schrute
When I bring the heat like Tai food
His face is what I'll punch right through when I bring this right through
He's light like the sun so I'll son this knight dude like high noon
I had my share of tough times too
I had a ponytail in high school
I rocked the snap back with a hole in the back
And I put my ponytail right through
But I thought it was tight dude
Hairspray and a scrunchie I kept it tight dude
Watch season 5 of Reba, that's what I do
Start twitching when I get around girls, that's what my eye do
But I'm so dedicated to the block
Two years ago I looked the streets in the eye and said, ""I do""
How many lamps do I own? Ten, that's five twos
I hope you hit a growth spurt and get to 5'2""
Seven is my favorite number in the world but I kinda like five too
You can't handle my thighs dude
This heat going straight over his head, that's how the crow fly
Nah, this heat going straight over his head, that's a blow dry
I'm so high, I always wanted to meet you so...""hi""
I know I'm one of the old guys but I'm one of the up and comers like Gjonaj
I'm so fly that I took this battle on one week Prep
And I'm not talking about the gun rapper with a bow tie
No lie
Smack, I should be the one that's headlining NOME 5
No but for real, for real, but this dude's pretty awesome too, for real...
{Gives Illmaculate a high 5}
I've always wanted to give a gnome 5
{Crowd absolutely loses its shit}

It's over. It's over

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about that
I've already hit him in the head with ten punches and I owe him five
If you said my cat was four years old he'd look up at you and say, ""No I'm five""
You better stop Carter before I go too far today
I cut fiber out of my diet, I'm down to two farts a day
You think Carter play?
Well I love the streets, I'm with that brass, I harp parades
This dude has the same body type of somebody who should be guarding a garden maze
But for real, my entire life is just one awkward phase
You spent one night in jail well I got bars for days
Time

It's already over. It's already over. I...that was some good shit
He's got 13 cats, 13, and he gives 'em all people names
So his friends get confused but he don't think it's strange
He be like, ""Hey man, are you coming in to Steven's games?""
""Steven is your brother?""
""Uh, Steven is the Siamese and tomorrow we're playing keep away.""
""I put this corn in a bag...Frito Lay""
Carter keeps arms around him in the streets these days
That's PDA
You'll get ripped off the cuff like your jeans are frayed
It's in your bloodline to be scared, yeah, your gene's afraid
I mean...back to the 17 cats
He remembers all their birthdays
Even assigns them personality quirks that weren't there in the first place
He be like, ""That's Mrs. Boots...she's a little moody on Thursdays
Between us girls, someone's having a bad fur day.""
There's more Carter than what meets the top layer
You're looking at a top notch neighbor, golf trainer, scotch drinking
Yacht sailor, squash player
So point out anyone you call ""hater""
And I'll make that bitch sit down, I'm a dog trainer
I'll tell 'em they suck forever like a Jawbreaker
Cock flavored
Flawed nature but God's greater
I do this for scratch without the cross fader
Yo, you know how this match looks on paper?
Like Swamp Gator versus blond skater
Darth Vader versus park ranger
Don Draper vers' John Mayer
That's a compliment, his songs...BANGERS
I mean, you look like you've never used a Mach razor and you're going to prom later
Also a compliment, you age well
Yo, truth be told he took this as a small favor
I only took this to make our bond greater like a stock trader
So, what do y'all think when you see Carter Deems?
Harvard steez? Art degrees?
No, he harvest p's, commits larcenies
And I'm pretty sure his baby picture was the cover of Carter 3
But look, we got some things in common Carter
See, we're both pussy lovers
Most battle rappers style...is cookie cutter
My mom was bleeding while baking, somehow a cookie cut her
I'm only jealous cause Joe partnered with Cutter
What you want? A cookie Carter?
Motherfucker, if I did have a cat, I'd be better at that
I'd pet mine smoother, wouldn't get mine neutered
His cats are used to being fed light tuna, psst, I fed mine grouper
Yo, I heard in high school he was a celeb like Bueller
But ten times cooler
He would show up in that Lex like Luther
Get to class, turn the desk chair around and sit behind the desk like ""booya!""
Soon as the bell rang, he became a sex life tutor, but he was 10 times cooler
Shit, yearbook voted him, most likely to pass away, Death By Cougar
No diss, I salute you like red, white, blue, you're the westside ruler
Not even a sidekick that read my future
Could've predicted little Illmac' vers' Head I.C.E. Jr

You must've written those lines in a hotel
Cause all you got is mini bars
Carter Deems got two mini bars
In my left pocket, that's where two pennies are
He's so gassed up when he farts it sounds exactly like a indy car
My gun's so mature, he wears khaki pants and listens to NPR
My gun's so mature he works for a marketing firm, in PR
By now, everybody knows that 'Mac can spit it
But he's like one of the classiest dudes in battle rap
He can easily school me like academics
Ummm....one week prep...sorry
Look, I'm tired of being humble in battle rap, I only want to rap a minute
So I come back...oh my gosh, I've never done this before...
{Crowd starts cheering for Carter}
For real, I'm about to hit him with them steel bars
I don't steal bars, but my bars got punches that hit real hard
Nah, I'm just kidding, I can't write those kind of lines about dude that got somebody that got those REAL bars
.........
You can catch me going 90 in the rental
Not worried about the incidentals
Still I get live like Jimmy Kimmel
You think I'm soft well I come back the harder way like when Penny dribble
The heat on, I put this beat on, I'm not talking about an instrumental
I Double Dare you if you got the guts, I'm a legend at hitting temples
I would never hit you in the temples
I just put that in cause it fit in the scheme with shows from Nickelodeon
I tried to fit in Keenan and Kel, All That but I couldn't to figure it out
Have to throw 'em in
And I don't even watch Jimmy Kimmel
If he walked in the door right now I wouldn't even know it's him
And I'm not hard at all, the biggest fears in my life are gluten and too much sodium
Just kidding, I'm HARD AS HECK!
I'm hard as heck
I got small rounds on big rounds, that's a pepperoni pizza, boy
And I deliver that heat to your front door like a pizza boy
Last week The Source said I'm the best rapper in the world and I know Pete's your boy
Okay, he didn't say that at all, I'm getting really nervous right now
So if you smell any pee, it's your boy
Just kidding, I'm not nervous at all
So you can disregard that pee and poopy smell
I'm going old school like Soupy Sales
Cause I'm back on point like King Koopa shell
You're not back on point, you're like a beluga whale
(Beluga whales don't have any points on their back)
Yo, I hope this nerd brought his pocket protector cause I'm going for his wallet next
I'll rob this tiny miniature person, that's a Polly Pocket check
All I do is pocket checks
And I know y'all don't like pocket checks but money in my pocket? Check
I got so many pocket checks that even my pocket checks got pocket checks
And if I pocket check these pocket checks
These pocket checks have more pocket checks
But now it's time to put 'em away
I put these pocket checks back in these pocket checks
Then I pocket checks, then I pocket these checks in my pocket
Check
I knew it was a terrible idea to take this battle
I could feel a change up in my intuition
Still I hit him with punch after punch
That's a change up into his chin
You'll feel worse than when I had to get a student loan cause of a change up in tuition
Every time I walk by a fountain I throw some change up, I'm in to wishing
I'm about to start cooking like bouillon
Get hotter than Tucson, your futon is what I put my foot on when I poop on
I know I'm new on, but the kid about to flip hair like Jimmy Neutron
Look, Ill' need to cut it out like coupon
Eating sweet treats that's all my Coupe on
What I mean is my car eats nothing but Captain Crunch cause the roof gone
Punch after punch, I'm about to get my fight on
Left hook, then I throw a right on, right on
I have him walking funny like Monty Python
I don't care if 'Mac brought the mac
Mac is what I put my nine on
I shouldn't have worn this mask, I think I'm allergic to nylon
For real, blow after blow, I hit him with another punch if 'Mac is in it
I pull...no for real I should've brought a mask that was hypoallergenic
That's all I got
Time!

Yo, he said one of his biggest fears was sodium
He said, ""I get nervous when I try to direct message you on Twitter.""
I said, ""So. DM.""
(That's so bad)
Alright look, I can't fuck with Carter cause his reps too street
You should just be happy that I let you eat
I mean, after this paycheck his cats will have wet food treats for the next two weeks
I bet your home is a mess
Get control of your pets
As a feminist, Carter thinks strip clubs are as low as it gets
And won't even look the Hooter's waitress in the eyes as a show of respect
I mean, on the bright side though
His pets gave him closure when he was rejected by the label owner
Cause you have the appeal of a sex tape from Oprah
And the physique of a wet table coaster
But lets be honest, you wouldn't have shit on me, in your pull up days
You look like you're fresh out your mullet phase
Should've shave, you've got the swag
Of an Umbro fanny pack full of AIDS
Your computer? A wack PC
I hope the user...contracts VD
I mean, have you heard his last EP?
Stuart from MadTV?
Yo, it's an understatement to say your ugly face is not photogenic
As a kid, when your parents bought picture frames
They prolly kept the stock photo's in it
Aye, fuck the bullshit, y'all wanna hear some real bars?!
Cool, cause this is the last stand
I mean, look at what blood's sport in the ring, I'm Van Damne
I pull up in a black Phantom, put the beats on him, I'm a rap fan
I'll smoke him like afghan wax grams
You wouldn't see this pussy pop in a lap dance
Every time you rap fam', I think cat hands
Paws/pause
But just in case you're not certain
It's a scientific fact that a cat owner is a lot worse than a dog person
It's science
I mean, these are the known facts
It's a cold stat
51% of serial rapists know or have known someone that owns cats
Look it up
Yo, I guess that shit should've been a warning
Cause Carter was arrested on suspicion of being part of a kidding porn ring
Slow it down! I said kitty porn ring!
He practices every day every chance he gets to
Even battling his cats like, ""Slow it down I just hissed you!""
Copy that
I bet you shit in the same litter box they potty at
And prolly act like you're in a relationship with the mommy cat
Like, ""I made you this nice origami hat. How come you never call me back?""
You should see the work this cat put in
He says, there's not a girl that could do for him what a cat couldn't
He be strutting through the neighborhood
Fuck around and get your cat tooken
Shit, his new name should be Bruce Wane cause he got a Cat Woman
That's bars
But truth be told it's sad cause he broke up with the Siamese and now he' on the rebound
I'm a fan of your weak style so giving you this ass whooping hurts me, ow/meow
At Petco, real-this a true story
At Petco, they got his face on wanted posters
For spray painting, ""Cat's Rule"" all over the dog enclosures
Yo, I knew you were a worthy match
But when I heard you were a cat burglar
I figured it was purses, cash or artwork you snatched
But no, he's a cat burglar, he burgles cats
Alright, I don't know if you heard his raps but his tracks are tight
I mean, Carter be remixing classics like...
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack with the cat to match
Whatever happened to catching a good old fashioned passionate ass whooping?
Getting your shoes, coat and cat tooken
Cats rule everything around me, get the money
(DOLLAR DOLLAR BILLS Y'ALL!)
I said...
""Cats rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. with the honey
Gotta lot of milk y'all!
But look, all that shit aside, I got a serious question
Be honest, and you'll win a prize
Do you jerk off?
Do you?

Yes

Ill advised, every time you jerk off a kitten dies
And you've practically committed genocideEmbed"
